# BlackHoleGame
## Hi, Welcome to the _Blackhole_ game.

- It is a ***Simple Two Player*** game.

- Intially, Player-1 and Player-2 both have 10 numbers from 1 to 10, and there is a board containing 21 holes **(See Images Below)**.  

- In each alternate turn player have to cover a hole using smallest of the numbers currently they have.   

- After all moves 1 hole remains unocuppied and that hole sucks all it's neighbour holes.   

- Winner is decided on the basis of who sucked least.
